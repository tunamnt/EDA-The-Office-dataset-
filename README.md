# EDA-The-Office-dataset-
In this EDA, there are 3 main tasks:

1. Finding out average rating over the season

2. Finding out top 5 director with highest rating and the number of episodes produced

3. Finding out if there is a difference in rating between episodes with guests and without guests

4. Correlation between variables

5. Creating a matplotlib scatter plot of the data that contains the following attributes:

- Each episode's episode number plotted along the x-axis
- Each episode's viewership (in millions) plotted along the y-axis
- A color scheme reflecting the scaled ratings (not the regular ratings) of each episode, such that:
+ Ratings < 0.25 are colored "red"
+ Ratings >= 0.25 and < 0.50 are colored "orange"
+ Ratings >= 0.50 and < 0.75 are colored "lightgreen"
+ Ratings >= 0.75 are colored "darkgreen"
- A sizing system, such that episodes with guest appearances have a marker size of 250 and episodes without are sized 25
- A title, reading "Popularity, Quality, and Guest Appearances on the Office"
- An x-axis label reading "Episode Number"
- A y-axis label reading "Viewership (Millions)"

6. Providing the name of one of the guest stars who was in the most watched Office episode.
